# Maoto Agent Template

A maoto agent can be run with open connection to the server or without.
In most cases we recommend NOT using an open connection for communication with the platform, since an open connection can be a security risk, more error-prone and less reliable.
However, in some cases this it can be quite handy, i.e.:
- when there is a NAT / Firewall between device and Internet
- There is no static IP address available for the maoto-agent
