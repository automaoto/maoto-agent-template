Ladies and Gentlemen.

This may very well be our last official visit
to the United States before retiring from

office next year.

There could not been a more moving start to
the visit than one which included being honoured

in this way by one of the great educational
institutions of this nation and of the world.

I know that through this award you are not
so much recognising any individual achievement,

but are rather paying tribute to the struggles
and achievements of the South African people

as a whole.

I humbly accept the award in that spirit,
while at the same time wishing you to know

that we are not unaware of nor unmoved by
the great compliment you pay us by conferring

this degree at a specially convened Convocation.

To join George Washington and Winston Churchill
as the other recipients of such an award conferred

at a specially convened Convocation, is not
only a singular honour.

It also holds great symbolic significance:
to the mind and to the future memory of this

great American institution, the name of an
African is now added to those two illustrious

leaders of the Western world.

If in these latter years of a life lived in
pursuit of equality, we can at last look upon

our own country as one in which citizens,
regardless of race, gender or creed, share

equal political rights and opportunities for
development, we do so with great gratitude

towards the millions upon millions all around
the world who materially and morally supported

our struggle for freedom and justice.

Together with those freedom- and justice-loving
citizens of the world, we do at the same time,

however, note that at the end of this century
- a century which humanity entered with such

high hopes for progress - the world is still
beset by great disparities between the rich

and the poor, both within countries and between
different parts of the world.

If in individual life we all may reach that
part of the long walk where the opportunity

is granted to retire to some rest and tranquillity,
for humanity the walk to freedom and equality

seems, alas, still to be long one ahead.

This august institution gains its standing
and reputation also from the manner in which

it has conducted, and continues to conduct,
itself as an international presence.

Wherever men and women of learning and thought
gather, its name and work are known.

It embodies that spirit of universality which
marks great universities.

To join the ranks of its alumni, is to be
reminded of the oneness of our global world.

The greatest single challenge facing our globalised
world is to combat and eradicate its disparities.

While in all parts of the world progress is
being made in entrenching democratic forms

of governance, we constantly need to remind
ourselves that the freedoms which democracy

brings will remain empty shells if they are
not accompanied by real and tangible improvements

in the material lives of the millions of ordinary
citizens of those countries.

Where men and women and children go burdened
with hunger, suffering from preventable diseases,

languishing in ignorance and illiteracy, or
finding themselves bereft of decent shelter,

talk of democracy and freedom that does not
recognise these material aspects, can ring

hollow and erode confidence exactly in those
values we seek to promote.

Hence our universal obligation towards the
building of a world in which there shall be

greater equality amongst nations and amongst
citizens of nations.

The disparity between the developed and developing
world, between North and South, reflects itself

also in the sphere of educational and intellectual
resources.

When in Africa we speak and dream of, and
work for, a rebirth of that continent as a

full participant in the affairs of the world
in the next century, we are deeply conscious

of how dependent that is on the mobilisation
and strengthening of the continent's resources

of learning.

The current world financial crisis also starkly
reminds us that many of the concepts that

guided our sense of how the world and its
affairs are best ordered, have suddenly been

shown to be wanting.

They are seen to have hidden real structural
defects in the world economic system.

The precepts of the economic theorists who
could so confidently prescribe to all, now

appear to have drawn much of their apparent
intellectual validation from having been unchallenged

by the day-to-day operations of a system that
operated in the interests of the powerful.

Not only does this crisis call for fundamental
rethinking and reconceptualisation on the

part of the theorists of the North.

It more particularly and urgently emphasises
the need for thinkers and intellectuals of

the developing world to sharpen their skills
and analyses, and for a genuine partnership

between those of the North and the South in
helping shape a world order that answers to

the shared and common needs of all peoples,
and not just the riches.

This university already has had a long partnership
of learning and teaching with the South African

people.

There are many names that one could mention
of persons now holding office in government

or in institutions of civil society who spent
time at Harvard or benefited from programmes

conducted jointly with this institution.

For that, our fledgling democracy faced with
enormous tasks of reconstruction and development

owes your institution a great debt of gratitude.

As South Africans play their role in helping
to conceptualise and give content to the African

Renaissance, we continue to draw upon the
intellectual skills nurtured and honed here.

The United States of America and democratic
South Africa have in the course of these last

four years built a relationship of mutual
respect and co-operation, each country respecting

the sovereignty of the other while co-operating
as partners.

As part of this relationship the scholars
who had the benefit of studying here, returned

better equipped to deal with the local challenges
and problems as Africans.

It is therefore a source of great encouragement
and inspiration for us to learn about the

"Emerging Africa" research project housed
in the newly-created Centre for International

Development at Harvard.

Its objective of undertaking an appraisal
of Africa 92s economic, social and political

history, as well as the problems facing the
continent, is timely and to be greatly welcomed.

That it will be doing this in collaboration
with African research institutions and scholars,

will serve to strengthen and build African
intellectual capacity to take charge of its

reconstruction and regeneration.

I am confident that it will also strengthen
and build your own understanding of African

reality and your capacity to analyse that
reality as part of our shared world.

Mister President, we accept this great honour
bestowed upon us today as a symbol of how

South Africa and the United States, Africa
and the West, the developing and the developed

world, are reaching out and joining hands
as partners in building a world order that

equally benefits all the nations and people
of the world.

For three hundred years this great institution
has served its nation with distinction.

We enter the new millennium in the hope that
the rich fruits of learning, science and technological

progress will in this coming century truly
be shared by all in this global village in

which we live.

We are confident that this institution of
which we are now a proud member will play

a leading role in achieving that.
